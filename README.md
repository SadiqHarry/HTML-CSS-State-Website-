## Introduction

To be successful as a front-end web designer or developer, you must be able to structure content in HTML and present a visual representation of the structure for various devices using CSS and JavaScript. In this task, you will further design, develop, and implement the low-level comprehensive page layout you created in the previous task. Your work for Task 2 will not be evaluated until Task 1 has been submitted and passed.

## Scenario

Congratulations, you got the job! You just finished your first week at the state government office where you completed the orientation and onboarding documentation. You have also met with your new supervisor daily to learn more about the department and expectations of your role, as well as your new colleagues who have been teaching you about the systems used in the office. You are now ready to develop the new website for the state government office.

## Requirements

Your submission must be your original work. No more than a combined total of 30% of a submission and no more than a 10% match to any one individual source can be directly quoted or closely paraphrased from sources, even if cited correctly. An originality report is provided when you submit your task that can be used as a guide.

## Functionality

The website consists of several web pages, each focusing on different aspects of the state and its cities. The main page serves as an introduction to the state, providing an overview and highlighting its unique features. Additionally, there are separate pages dedicated to the state capital and two other cities within the state. Each city page includes the following information:

- **Population:** The current population of the city.
- **Year of Incorporation:** The year the city was officially incorporated.
- **Region:** The specific region within the state where the city is located.
- **Classification:** Indicates whether the city is urban, suburban, rural, or a combination.
- **Average Income Level:** Compares the average income of the city with the rest of the state.

To enhance the user experience and ensure accessibility, the website incorporates various HTML elements and semantic markup. Each page includes a descriptive title in the head section, allowing search engines and users to identify the page's topic. Relevant images are used throughout the website, accompanied by alternative text to provide descriptions for visually impaired users.

The website also features a consistent navigation menu that allows visitors to easily switch between different pages. The menu ensures a seamless browsing experience and helps users find the desired information quickly. Additionally, the website employs semantic elements, such as headers, navigation sections, main content areas, and asides, to provide clear organization and structure.

## Additional Elements

In addition to the core functionality described above, the website includes the following elements:

- **External Link:** The website includes a link that opens an external website in a new window or tab using the target attribute. This allows visitors to access relevant external resources without leaving the main website.
- **Ordered and Unordered Lists:** An HTML-coded ordered list is included with at least three list items, presenting information in a structured and organized manner. Similarly, an HTML-coded unordered list with at least three list items is utilized to convey related content.
- **Table:** The website incorporates an HTML-coded table consisting of 3-6 columns and 3-6 rows. This table format is used to effectively present and organize specific content.

## Styling and CSS

To enhance the visual appeal and improve the overall user experience, an external CSS file is utilized to define the website's styles and formatting. The CSS file includes the following rules and techniques:

1. **Text Styles:** Various text styles are implemented, including a specific font-family declaration for consistent typography throughout the website. Additionally, a :hover pseudo-class is employed to create rollover effects for navigation buttons, providing visual feedback to users when they interact with the navigation menu.

2. **Float Property:** The float property is utilized to position at least one HTML element alongside another element on the web page. This technique allows for flexible and responsive layouts.

3. **Positioning:** Both absolute and relative positioning are employed in different areas of the website to precisely place elements within the web page. This ensures proper alignment and visual hierarchy of the content.

4. **Selector Types:** Various selector types are used to target specific HTML elements for styling purposes. These include element selectors, class selectors (used multiple times for consistent styling), and ID selectors to format specific elements on the page.

## Form and JavaScript Validation

One page of the website includes a form that allows users to enter their information and ask questions. The form includes the following fields:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Email Address
- Email Confirmation (for verification)
- Question (text box)

To enhance user experience and ensure data accuracy, JavaScript code is implemented to verify that the email fields match. When a user enters a second email address, the JavaScript code checks if it matches the original email address field, providing instant feedback to the user.

## Hosting and Submission

The completed website, including all HTML pages, external CSS documents, and images, is uploaded to a free hosting site as specified in the assignment requirements. The website is accessible to the public, allowing visitors to explore the content and learn about the state and its cities.

For submission purposes, a ZIP file containing all project files, including images and other media used in the website, is provided. Both the hosted site and the submitted files are evaluated to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Please note that all code in this project is original and created specifically for this assignment. No premade templates or external resources were used to ensure the authenticity and originality of the work.
