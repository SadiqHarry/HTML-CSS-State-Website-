North Carolina State Government Office Website
This project is a website for the North Carolina State Government Office. The website provides information about the state of North Carolina and focuses on three cities within the state: Cary, Durham, and Raleigh. It serves as a platform to showcase key details about each city, such as population, incorporation year, region, classification, and average income level compared to the rest of the state.

Functionality
The website consists of multiple web pages that highlight different aspects of North Carolina and its cities. The main page acts as an introduction to the state, providing an overview of its history, culture, and notable features. Additionally, there are separate pages dedicated to Cary, Durham, and Raleigh, respectively, focusing on the unique characteristics of each city.

City Pages
Each city page includes the following information:

Population: The current population of the city.
Year of Incorporation: The year the city was officially incorporated.
Region: The specific region within North Carolina where the city is located.
Classification: Indicates whether the city is urban, suburban, rural, or a combination.
Average Income Level: Compares the average income of the city with the rest of the state.
These details aim to provide visitors with a comprehensive understanding of each city's demographics, history, and economic profile.

Navigation and Structure
To ensure a seamless browsing experience, the website features a consistent navigation menu that allows visitors to easily navigate between different pages. The menu is present on every page and provides intuitive links to the main page, as well as the individual city pages. This navigation system ensures that users can effortlessly explore the desired content without any confusion.

Moreover, the website incorporates HTML semantic elements to enhance organization and structure. Each page includes a descriptive header that introduces the content, allowing users to quickly understand the purpose and context of the page. A navigation section is also present, providing links to other pages within the website. The main content section contains the core information about the state or city, while an aside section may display additional information or related content.

Additional Elements
In addition to the core functionality described above, the website includes various elements to enhance the user experience and provide organized information:

External Link: The website includes a link that opens an external website in a new window or tab using the target attribute. This feature enables visitors to access relevant external resources without leaving the main website.
Ordered and Unordered Lists: An HTML-coded ordered list is utilized to present information in a structured manner. Additionally, an unordered list is employed to convey related content, providing bullet-pointed details in an easily readable format.
Table: The website incorporates an HTML-coded table consisting of 3-6 columns and 3-6 rows. This table format is utilized to effectively present and organize specific content, allowing visitors to compare and contrast various aspects of the state or cities.
Styling and CSS
To enhance the visual appeal and overall aesthetics of the website, an external CSS file is utilized to define styles and formatting. The CSS file includes the following rules and techniques:

Text Styles: The CSS file defines a specific font-family declaration, ensuring consistent typography throughout the website. Additionally, a :hover pseudo-class is used to create rollover effects for navigation buttons, providing visual feedback to users when they interact with the navigation menu.

Float Property: The float property is employed to position at least one HTML element alongside another element on the web page. This technique allows for flexible and responsive layouts, enhancing the visual flow of the content.

Positioning: Both absolute and relative positioning are utilized in different areas of the website to precisely place elements within the web page. This ensures proper alignment and visual hierarchy of the content, improving readability and user experience.

Selector Types: The CSS file utilizes various selector types to target specific HTML elements for styling purposes. These include element selectors, class selectors (used multiple times for consistent styling), and ID selectors to format specific elements on the page, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing design.

Form and JavaScript Validation
One page of the website includes a form that allows users to provide their information and ask questions. The form includes the following fields:

First Name
Last Name
Email Address
Email Confirmation (for verification)
Question (text box)
To enhance user experience and ensure data accuracy, JavaScript code is implemented to verify that the email fields match. When a user enters a second email address, the JavaScript code checks if it matches the original email address field, providing instant feedback to the user.

Hosting and Submission
The completed website, including all HTML pages, external CSS documents, and images, is uploaded to a free hosting site as specified in the assignment requirements. The website is accessible to the public, allowing visitors to explore the content and learn about North Carolina and its cities.

For submission purposes, a ZIP file containing all project files, including images and other media used in the website, is provided. Both the hosted site and the submitted files are evaluated to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Please note that all code in this project is original and created specifically for this assignment. No premade templates or external resources were used to ensure the authenticity and originality of the work.
